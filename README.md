### Slide in with scroll

This repo shows the effect of images showing up on scroll, made with vanilla  JavaScript.

Debounce function helps optimizing the performace by calling the function every 20 miliseconds.

Function checkSlide adds or removes the class 'active' from images, based upon the calculation logic inside.

If an image is half way show, it will fade in with the help of transform translateX property in CSS.

When we pass the image, it gets hidden again, and shown again if we scroll up.
